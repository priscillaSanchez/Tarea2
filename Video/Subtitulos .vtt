00:00.000 --> 00:08.290
Advice from the book Atomic Habits
1. Small habits lead to big changes. If you get 1% better every day,

00:08.290 --> 00:10.400
you’ll be 37 times better by the end of the year.

00:10.400 --> 00:23.410
Goals are the results you want to achieve.

00:23.410 --> 00:24.870
Systems are the processes

00:24.870 --> 00:25.270
that will lead you to those goals.

00:25.920 --> 00:26.060
3.

00:26.060 --> 00:28.060
If you want to change your habits,

00:28.060 --> 00:29.420
change your identity.

00:29.920 --> 00:32.180
When a habit comes from who we are,

00:32.180 --> 00:34.040
it’s much easier to follow.

00:34.050 --> 00:34.970
And number four,

00:34.970 --> 00:36.690
follow the four laws of change.

00:37.250 --> 00:38.140
Make it obvious,

00:38.140 --> 00:38.840
attractive,

00:38.840 --> 00:39.980
easy and satisfying.
